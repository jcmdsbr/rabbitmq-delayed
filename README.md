### RabbitMQ Delayed Message Plugin ðŸ’¡

This plugin adds delayed-messaging (or scheduled-messaging) to
RabbitMQ.

A user can declare an exchange with the type `x-delayed-message` and
then publish messages with the custom header `x-delay` expressing in
milliseconds a delay time for the message. The message will be
delivered to the respective queues after `x-delay` milliseconds.
